# ccglab-models
models for parser training and wide-coverage/ a companion to ccglab and ccglab-grammars

You need to install <a href="https://github.com/bozsahin/ccglab">ccglab</a> repo to computationally try the
models included here.

<b>If you have a CCGlab model developed, feel free to send a pull request.
We will put it up in this repo.</b>

In each folder:

  <code>.ccg</code> file is the source grammar you type. (the grammar)

  <code>.ccg.lisp</code> file is the lisp-ready code ccglab uses for model development, training and parse ranking. (the model- and lisp-ready grammar). 

  <code>.sup</code> and <code>.supervision</code> files are for model training from sentence-lf pairs.

Other files are auxiliary.

These grammars are separated from <a href="https://github.com/bozsahin/ccglab-grammars">ccglab-grammars</a> source code
to address two different worlds easier, namely linguists and computational linguists/cognitive scientists.
